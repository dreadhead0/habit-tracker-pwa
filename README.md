# Habit Tracker PWA

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **mobile-first Habit Tracker Progressive Web App (PWA)** built as a direct implementation of a strict technical specification. The goal is not product exploration, but **accurate translation of requirements into deterministic, testable software**.

The application allows users to:

- Sign up and log in locally
- Create, edit, and delete habits
- Mark habits as completed for the current day
- Track current streaks based on consecutive completions
- Persist data across sessions using localStorage
- Install the app as a PWA
- Use the app offline after initial load without crashes

The implementation strictly follows the provided technical document and is validated through **unit, integration, and end-to-end tests**.

---

## ✨ Additional Features

The following enhancements were implemented beyond the base technical specification:

### 🎨 Habit Customization

- Emoji picker for each habit (visual identity per habit)
- Color picker for habit categorization and UI personalization
- Dynamic habit card theming based on selected color

### 🌙 Theme Support

- Light mode and dark mode toggle
- Theme preference persisted locally in localStorage
- UI adapts across all core screens (login, signup, dashboard)

These features improve usability and visual clarity while remaining fully compliant with the local-only persistence requirement.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **localStorage (persistence layer)**
- **Vitest (unit testing)**
- **React Testing Library (integration testing)**
- **Playwright (end-to-end testing)**

🌐 Live Demo

🔗 Live URL: <https://habit-tracker-pwa-production.up.railway.app>

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Precious-Odion/habit-tracker-pwa>
cd habit-tracker-pwa
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Run Instructions

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## 🧪 Test Instructions

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run specific suites:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

### ⚠️ Note on Test Scripts

The technical requirement defines:

```json
"test:unit": "vitest run --coverage",
"test:integration": "vitest run"
```

This implementation refines them to target specific directories:

```json
"test:unit": "vitest run tests/unit --coverage",
"test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration"
```

This ensures faster execution and better test isolation while maintaining the required script names.

---

## 💾 Local Persistence Design

The application uses **localStorage** as a deterministic persistence layer.

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

Data is stored locally per browser using localStorage.  
Cross-device or cross-browser synchronization is not supported.

Each browser instance maintains its own isolated dataset.

---

### Keys

````txt
habit-tracker-users
habit-tracker-session
habit-tracker-habits



### Data Structures

**Users**

```ts
{
  id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
````

**Session**

```ts
{
  userId: string;
  email: string;
}
```

**Habits**

```ts
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  frequency: 'daily';
  createdAt: string;
  completions: string[];
  emoji?: string;
  color?: string;
}
```

### Guarantees

- IDs are generated using `crypto.randomUUID()` (globally unique)
- Completion dates are stored as **ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD)**
- Duplicate completion dates are prevented
- Data is scoped per user per browser

## 📱 PWA Implementation

The application satisfies the PWA contract:

### Required Files

```
public/manifest.json
public/sw.js
public/icons/icon-192.png
public/icons/icon-512.png
```

How the service worker works:

The service worker (sw.js) caches the app shell
The app becomes installable via browser
Offline usage is supported after first load
App does not crash when offline

🧠 Why ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx Exists

src/components/shared/ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx

Next.js App Router runs both server and client components.

The service worker must be registered only on the client, because:

navigator.serviceWorker is not available on the server
Registering it in server components would cause runtime errors

This component:

Runs inside a useEffect
Ensures safe client-side registration
Keeps service worker logic isolated and predictable

This design ensures compliance with the requirement:

"The app must register the service worker on the client"

### Features Implemented

- Installable via browser prompt
- Service worker registered on client
- App shell caching strategy
- Offline support after first load
- No hard crash when offline

### 🎨 UI Enhancements

- Emoji picker integrated into habit creation/editing flow
- Color picker allows users to visually categorize habits
- Dark mode / light mode toggle implemented across the application
- Theme preference persisted using localStorage

### Offline Behavior

The service worker caches:

```txt
/, /login, /signup, /dashboard
```

This allows the app shell to render even without network connectivity.

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs and Limitations

- No multi-device synchronization due to localStorage-based architecture (per requirement constraint)
- **No backend**: authentication is local and not secure (intended for this stage)
- **No multi-device sync**: data is tied to browser storage
- **Basic service worker strategy**: focuses on app shell caching, not full offline data sync
- **No advanced validation UI feedback system** beyond required scope
- **Duplicate habit names are prevented**, but UX feedback is minimal by design

These decisions align with the requirement to keep the system **deterministic and front-end focused**.

## 🧪 Test Coverage Summary

- **Unit Tests (Vitest)** → utilities in `src/lib`
- **Integration Tests (RTL)** → auth and habit flows
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)** → full user journey

### Coverage Report

## 📊 Coverage Report

The project uses Vitest with v8 coverage.

Latest coverage:

- Lines: 96.15%
- Branches: 100%
- Functions: 83.33%
- Statements: 96.15%

To generate coverage locally:

````bash
npm run test:unit

```txt
96.15% line coverage in src/lib
````

This exceeds the required **80% minimum**.
